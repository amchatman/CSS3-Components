            <span class="white">Lately I been caught up in my feelings
            Cus I was moving way up no ceiling
            I grabbed a chance heaven sent
            It ain't been the same ever since</span>
            I'm waking up, sweating every morning
            Fighting myself in my dream
            I'm my own opponent
            Every now and then
            I pop a pill to numb it down
            Voice inside my head I need to turn it down yea
        </p>
        <p class="song-lyric tid">Can't hold it down any longer I'm clipping
            Swear all these people just praying til I'm slipping
            One thing I can't ignore is that I'm different
            <span class="highlight">The way I envision my future ambitions
            Chips on the table, I raise to the max
            Can't beat my hand, Imma leave with the bags
            Riding the wave I create on my own
            Imma jump in and give it all</span>

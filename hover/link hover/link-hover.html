                I don't wanna see

                The best you ever heard
                I don't need to cheat
                But always coming first
                Yes I'm a nerd
                But I'll still school you
                Crazy is normal
                Do what the loons do
                Busy being home
                I'm busy being lonely
                My life is on the line
                Please never ever call me
